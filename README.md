Micro service framework where services instances are register itself to APIGateway. 
This is just POC level and lot things are yet to complete but still it will give a idea about how micro services management can be simplify.   Following aspects of the micro services are amid to address with this framework. 
1.	Service discovery 
2.	Service to service communication
3.	Web console to discover the current up & down services 
4.	Web console to monitor a traffic over the services 
5.	Raise notifications for down services 
6.	Register and expose micro service through API Gateway with zero configuration at APIGateway end.
7.	And so on..  Still thinking what else we can be simplify
